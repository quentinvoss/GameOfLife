With this Programm you can play Conway's Game of Life on your Computer.
You can turn cells on and off by clicking on them. Simple hit space to unpause and the game starts.
To move around use WASD controls.
If you want to change the size of the cells, simply run
```
GameOfLife [Your cell size]
```
in your terminal.

The performance is not the best, but hey I made this in a couple of hours so don't blame me.
